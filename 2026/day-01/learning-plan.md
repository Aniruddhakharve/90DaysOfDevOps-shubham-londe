# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level
I am currently an MCA student and a fresher who is trying to build a career in DevOps and Cloud.  
I have basic knowledge of Linux commands, Git, and AWS from practice and projects, but I still consider myself a beginner who is learning step by step.

## Why I am starting DevOps & Cloud
I am starting this journey because I genuinely enjoy working with Linux, servers, and cloud technologies.  
DevOps feels interesting to me because it is not only about coding but also about automation, infrastructure, and solving real-world problems.  
My goal is to become job-ready and confident so that I can apply for DevOps or Linux-based roles in the near future.

## Where I want to reach
By the end of these 90 days, I want to be much more confident in my fundamentals.  
I want to understand how real-world deployments work and how tools like Git, Docker, and cloud platforms are used together.  
I also want to build projects that I can show on my resume and GitHub.

## My 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days
- Improve my Linux fundamentals and become comfortable working in the terminal every day  
- Deploy at least one real application on AWS and understand the process properly  
- Learn Git, CI/CD basics, and Docker so I can create simple pipelines and deployments  

## Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build
- Linux troubleshooting and command-line confidence  
- Git and GitHub workflow for real projects  
- Basic CI/CD and container concepts  

## Weekly Time Commitment
I will dedicate around 2 hours every weekday for learning and practice.  
On weekends, I will spend 4–5 hours revising, doing hands-on tasks, and completing pending challenges.

## Consistency Plan
My main focus is consistency. Even if I cannot study for long hours on some days, I will still try to do at least 1 hour of practice.  
I will follow the daily tasks, push my work to GitHub, and track my progress.  
This 90-day plan is a personal commitment to stay disciplined and build a strong base in DevOps step by step.

I am starting this journey seriously and I want to stay consistent till the end.
